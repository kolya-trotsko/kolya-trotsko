### Hi there 👋

I'm Mykola Trotsko, a Python Developer 🐍💻

With approximately two years of experience, I have a diverse background working as a web developer, Python instructor, and Python developer. My experience encompasses web scraping, website development, automation, and Telegram bot development. During my freelance career, I refined my skills and actively contributed to projects, including a bot for students that checked power outage schedules.

Recognizing the advantages of professional stability, I transitioned to a Python developer role within a company. My focus is on integrating software solutions to streamline routine tasks for colleagues, ultimately enhancing productivity and efficiency. I am currently a mid-level Python developer and am looking for a company where I can continue my growth. 😊🚀
